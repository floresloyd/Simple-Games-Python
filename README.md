# Blackjack
Rules : Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; 
            a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value,
            and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10.
